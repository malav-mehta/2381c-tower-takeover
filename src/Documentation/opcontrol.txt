Goofy Tower Macros 
    There are 3 buttons for goofy tower macros
        left_digital triggers the small tower macro
        right_digital triggers the medium tower macro
        down_digital resets the transmission and goofy arm 
    
    The Basic Program Structure for Macros 
        If statements to check when buttons are pressed

        Each if statement has their own condition based off a variable called control, when each button is pressed, 
        the value of control will change and a different conditional statement will be called whether to do small, 
        medium towers, or a goofy reset. 

        The encoder values of the goofy arm were recorded at specific heights designated for the small medium towers.
        The goofy arm is then initiated ad told to stop once it reaches the value.

        Due to the extreme weight of the goofy arm, the motors need to be running at a speed of 5rpm in order to keep
        the arm still and to counter the weight of the arm. Functions like brake_mode are unable to balance the weight 
        of the arm and a counter-force is required.

        The goofy arm is lifted through reverse speed and is reset by setting a positive motor speed.
